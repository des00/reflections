How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see typo by comparing two version of files, so I can find bugs easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Use source control system, scm. Or, programmer can use so many folder,
    that including modified date in folder name.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Creating a commit by user manually is good to divide logical branch,
    but if some mistakes happen before creating a commit, work results go away.
    So automatic saving way is good idea to unpredictable accident.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for programmer, and program source code interact each other so
    allowing saving multiple files are essential function.
    But google docs only care one doc file, because each doc doesn't depend
    on like source code. These docs just need each history and it's enough.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use these commands easily, and color can recognize all differences.
    But, so many letter confuse me.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Even bug is introduced, I can quickly find when it is introduced,
    and I can fix it immediately. So I can develop more aggresively.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To manage source code and text files
