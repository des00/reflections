When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Business trip, or to cowork.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Unnecessary pulling can cause deleting my working result.
   If there are some commits what I works, but it conflict with remote
   repository, it cause unstable status.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork : clone acting inside of github. to copy another's branch that
            I don't have permission of push.
    clone : copy project. to work my local space and don't need to share
            another people.
    branches : fix bug, add new feature, and so on.
                or, version control.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Local remote repository can keep up-to-date status, so I can compare
    my local working directory and get result.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Sharing files are easy way to colaborate\
    But merging into master (if there is master content on sharing files system)
    or review, and discussion is really hard.    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
